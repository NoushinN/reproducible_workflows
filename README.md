# Introduction to reproducible research
A repository to house materials for a workshop introducing participants to reproducible research principles.


The goal of  workshop is to teach _new-to-programming_  professionals to reproducible research using the program R. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of reproducible research.
